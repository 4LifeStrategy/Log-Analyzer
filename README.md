**Log-Analyzer** is a script to parse system or web server logs for suspicious activities.

## Define the Scope

- **Objective**: Automate the analysis of logs to identify suspicious activities like brute force attacks, failed login attempts, or access anomalies.
- **Input**: Log files (e.g., system logs, web server logs like Apache or NGINX logs).
- **Output**: Insights such as:
  - Suspicious IP addresses.
  - Frequency of access per user/IP.
  - Unusual access times or locations.
  - Error or failed login attempts. 

## Tools

- Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - re (for regex pattern matching)
  - pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
  - matplotlib or seaborn (for visualizing patterns)
  - argparse (for command-line functionality)
  - datetime (for timestamp analysis

## Workflow

1. Input Log File:
    - Use a sample log file for testing (e.g., /var/log/auth.log for Linux or a sample Apache access log file).

2. Log Parsing:
    - Identify the format of your log file and write a parser using regex or string splitting.

3. Data Analysis:
    - Extract and analyze key fields such as timestamps, IP addresses, and error codes.

4. Reporting:
    - Summarize findings into readable reports (e.g., most frequent IPs, time of peak activity).

5. Visualization (Optional):
    - Create graphs to show login attempts over time or geographic locations of IPs.
